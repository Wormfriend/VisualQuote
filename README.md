# VisualQuote

Allows automazied creation of Wallpapers containing a Quote of a famous person.

This little Python3-library provides quotes from https://www.brainyquote.com/ and creates a wallpaper, which is then saved in the User Pictures-Folder. Fontstyle and author of quote can easily be changed.

Just set VisualQuote.py to be run at startup for automatization and dynamic wallpapers.

PS: Please don't be too harsh on my coding, I only spent a couple of hours and it's by far not perfect. But I really liked the outcome.

PSS: If you have ideas for improving the project, please feel free to join or comment!
